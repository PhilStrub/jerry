Subject: Inquiry Regarding AW Rental Program & Suggestion for Loyalty Benefits

Dear AdventureWorks Team,

I am exploring options for organizing a cycling retreat for my employees and came across your AW Rental Services in the AdventureWorks documentation. Before planning further, could you clarify the following?
	1.	Do you provide group rental rates for Road-150 or Mountain-500 bikes?
	2.	Is there a maximum number of units that can be reserved in advance?
	3.	Are helmets and GPS units from the Accessories catalog included or rented separately?

Additionally, I’d like to suggest adding a loyalty or corporate partnership program. Many of us who rent from AW also purchase bikes later, and it might encourage recurring business.

Thank you for your time,
Rachel Chen
