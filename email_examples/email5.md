Subject: Recurring Problems With the Hydraulic Brake System—Mountain-200 Red

Dear AdventureWorks Customer Care,

I’m writing to express my frustration with the Mountain-200 Red, size 42 that I purchased last month (Order #AWR-48251). After only two weeks of moderate use, the hydraulic brake system began leaking fluid. This is especially disappointing because I previously had similar issues with another AW bike (Mountain-300) last year.

At this point, I’m concerned that there may be a manufacturing defect in the brake components listed under ProductCategoryID 2 in your database. I would appreciate a warranty repair or a full unit replacement.

Please let me know the next steps as soon as possible.

Regards,
Jonathan P.
