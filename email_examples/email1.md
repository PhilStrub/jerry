Subject: Urgent: Defective Mountain-100 Frame Purchased Last Week

Dear AW Support,

I’m reaching out because the Mountain-100 Silver, size 46 that I purchased last Thursday developed a crack near the seat tube after my very first trail ride. I expected high durability from your Mountain series, so this is concerning.

Please advise on how to proceed with a replacement or refund.

Thank you,
Mark L.
