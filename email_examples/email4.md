Subject: Suggestion for Adding More Electric-Assisted Models

Hi AW Product Team,

I’ve been a long-time AdventureWorks customer and often browse your online catalog. I noticed that while you offer an impressive range of road and mountain bikes, the e-bike segment seems underrepresented. Given current market trends and customer demand, would you consider expanding the Electric Commuter or Electric Trail categories in future releases?

Just a friendly suggestion—I love your products and would be excited to see this added!

Warm regards,
Sophie
