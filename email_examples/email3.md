Subject: Questions About Compatibility of Accessories With Touring-1000

Hello AdventureWorks Team,

I recently bought a Touring-1000 Yellow bike and I’m considering adding front and rear racks from your Accessories catalog. Before ordering, could you confirm whether product IDs 606 and 607 from the AdventureWorks database are fully compatible with this model?

Also, do you offer installation services at the Portland store location?

Thank you in advance,
Elena Gómez
